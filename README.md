# plotly_deploy

## Project Overview
The project consisted of publishing the research data from a microbiology laboratory to the web, as a dashboard containing bacterial data for each volunteer that took part in the study. The webpage contains a dropdown that allows the user to filter the data by the volunteer's ID and view the following tables and charts, which will be updated dynamically:

- A panel for demographic information about the volunteer;
- The top 10 bacterial species found, in the form of a bar chart;
- The relative frequency of all the bacterial species found, in the form of a bubble chart;
- The weekly washing frequency of the individual's belly button, in the form of a gauge chart.

## Resources
- Data source: samples.json
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.43.1, JavaScript, HTML
